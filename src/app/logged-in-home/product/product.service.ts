It sets the bar high on looks, power, weight and features all the tech you would expect. There's Ohlins electrically adjustable suspension, cornering ABS, slide control, a lean angle aware quickshifter, gorgeous TFT dash and of course the stunning single sided swingarm with no massive exhaust to ruin the lines.",

The engine is supercharged plus between 2017 and 2019 it gained all the modern tech you could want, such as the up / down quickshifter, cornering ABS, Ohlins TTX36 shock, Brembo Stylema brakes, self healing paint and a fancy TFT dash. Of course 200 bhp isn't enough so they added another 40 bhp (with ram-air) while they were at it!",
